CourseraTool
============

Mostly a scala learning exercise. This tool will use [apache.HttpClient] to connect to Coursera,
and go trough all users videos, for all classes, and synchronize them to a local folder.
The primary goal is to explore Scala, but might as well can make it useful.
As a learning exercise, it will probably be over engineered, but that's OK, 
the scope is to embrace the features and paradigms of scala as much as possible. 


The Coursera backend turned out to be more complex than I cared to examine,
so I stopped as soon as I felt that I got a good feeel of the language. 
As a result, the tool is totally usless, unless you are in the buisness of 
learning Scala.
