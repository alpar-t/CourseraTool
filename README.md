CourseraTool
============

Mostly a scala learning exercise. This tool will use [apache.HttpClient] to connect to Coursera,
and go trough all users videos, for all classes, and synchronize them to a local folder.
The primary goal is to explore Scala, but might as well can make it useful.
As a learning exercise, it will probably be over engineered, but that's OK, 
the scope is to embrace the features and paradigms of scala as much as possible. 


TODO
====

One would do most of them while developing, but doing them in phases 
makes it easier to focus on one thin at a time.
